  <h1>Complicated Standard, latest version</h1>

  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>There are clients, and there are servers. They shall communicate with each other
     and understand each other really well.</p>

  <h2>Behaviors</h2>

  <h3>Ahem</h3>
  <p>Every night when midnight strikes in UTC, the client shall send an &quot;Ahem&quot;
     request to the server. The server, open receipt, shall respond, within 5sec, with
     &quot;One of these nights again&quot;.
  </p>

  <h3>Nudge Nudge</h3>
  <p>The client may send the "Nudge Nudge" message to the server. The server then responds
     with &quot;I beg your pardon&quot;.</p>

  <p>If the server receives an unknown message from the client, it must respond with an
     error code.</p>
